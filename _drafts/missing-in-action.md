I read Robert McChesney's article in the International Journal of Communication this week and these are my reflections.

* Must read Gilens & Page, 2014

McChesney highlights a really interesting situation that Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft are the three most valuable publicly listed companies in America. Including those three, 5 of the top 8 most valuable companies are information technology companies. These publicly listed companies (and Facebook) have a monopoly that is unrivaled in their respective section IT that is unheard of in any other industry. Each one is large enough to control their respective markets.

Much of McChesney's essay focuses on the communications field and communications departments at American universities in particular. It looks at the situation and does not see much room for optimism.

One more interesting point:

>"Do we just add up a stack of microvictories and, suddenly, get a society that does not produce routinely so much injustice? I do not think that is how social change works; it comes in democratic waves when many ideas that, once, were thought to be marginal become mainstream and a flurry of radical reforms ensue."

That's why we need to do things.

This paper wasn't particularly useful for my assignment. It has some nice filler but was much more an opinion piece/essay aimed at the communications community rather than examples of how things are being done to make change amongst the public.

Hopefully the next one is better.
