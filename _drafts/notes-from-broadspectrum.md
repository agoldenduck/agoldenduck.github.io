* login page needs to be more reactive
* Default FROM user doesn't get saved when changed
    * All users don't get saved when changed

    * Cost centres linked to accounts could help adoption?
* Screenshot prices to whoever needs to pay for delivery
* Did you mean? input should it show every time?
* Unit input is too restrictive
    * e.g. Sydney Ferries address
* To be discussed seems suspicious?
* Multiple recipients for single shipment with multiple items
    * Cannot specify different receivers for each package
* Is it clear how to make a default? Is default per user or per company
* SLOW AS FUCK!
