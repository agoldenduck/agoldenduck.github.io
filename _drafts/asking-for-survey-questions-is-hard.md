Asking for survey responses is scary. What if people think the premise of my assignment is ridiculous? What if they don't think the questions are valid? What if no-one responds?

I find putting myself out there online and on social spaces difficult, I admit it. It's taken me a while with a bit of procrastination but now I'm ready to send the questions into the ether and get some feedback on my crazy ideas.

The difficult process of getting ethics approval was a relief in some ways because I didn't have to confront these scary demons just yet. Not today. But finally it is today and I sent the final copy of the front page to Julia, oh yeah but she's on leave. Uh oh...

So let's start from the beginning, what's been happening? I got the confirmation from Julia that I could go ahead with the project last month and then Christmas happened and New Year's and crazy work to make sure I could afford to live. So now it's almost a month later and I put together the requirements for the approval and sent it to her only to get an out of office reply. Yikes.

I've been finding self directed study challenging as I have said before. I was finally patting myself on the back with my initiative at getting up and at 'em. I mean sure it's a bit delayed but that's the uni student work curve isn't it? Save lots of it until the last minute you can. Ho hum.

I'm going to contact Sam Ferguson to see if he can help in the interim (please don't be on leave Sam).

So about doing the assignment progressively from now on... A really good strategy my wife has found success with recently is a type of egg timer program. It goes like:
1. Only planning how much work you are going to do one day in advance
1. Set yourself a time limit and only work that long
2. Download all your resources and turn off the internet
3. Have only one reference, your notes, and your journal open at once
4. Write and read like mad for the allotted time
5. It doesn't matter if you're writing in your journal (for me it's this document) or taking notes, as long as you're working
6. If you find you got distracted (even with the internet off, impressive!), then you must plan less time for work the next day
7. Repeat

Well I'm doing it today and it seems to be working. I'll let you know how it goes from here.
