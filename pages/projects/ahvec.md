The After Hours Veterinary Emergency Centre required a new website that was fast and mobile first. They wanted to be able to update information including staff and resources for customers. Finally, they wanted relevant calls to action that instructed visitors on what to do in an emergency.

I designed and built [ahvec.com.au](https://ahvec.com.au) for them as a small size static site, hosted on a content delivery network. Page load and navigation speeds were reduced by over 50% from the old site. I made the design mobile first and saw mobile use increase from a quarter to just over half of all users, and for those mobile users to stay on the page rather than immediately dropping out.

To allow content modification, I built a small keystonejs backend that triggers a minor rebuild of the site when content is changed or created.
